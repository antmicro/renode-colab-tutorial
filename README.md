Copyright (c) 2022-2023 [Antmicro](https://www.antmicro.com)

[Renode](https://renode.io) is an open-source simulation framework, allowing you to run, debug and test the same software you would run on hardware.

This is a tutorial for basic Renode usage, oriented around its support for Custom Function Units (CFUs) - ML accelerators for RISC-V ISA.

To run the tutorial, open the .ipynb file and click "Run in Google Colab".
Please note that this requires you to log in with your Google account.

You can also run it locally, by [downloading Renode](https://builds.renode/io) and running commands manually.
